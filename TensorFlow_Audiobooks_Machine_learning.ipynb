    "You are given data from an audiobook app.logically, it relates only to the audio versions of books.Each customer in the database has made a purchase at least once, that's why he/she is in the database. We want to create a machine learning algorithm based on our available data that can predict if a customer will buy again from the audiobook company.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is that if a customer has a low probability of coming back, there is no reason to spend any money on advertizing to him/her. If we can focus our efforts only on customers that are likely to convert again, we can make great savings, Moreover, this model can identify the most important metrics for a customer to come back again. Identify new customers creates value and growth opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a .csv summarizing the data. There are serveral variables:Customer ID, Book length in mins_Avg (Average of all purchaes), Book length in minutes_sum(sum of all purchase) Price Paid_avg(Average of all purcahes), Price paid_sum(sum of all purchaes), REview(a boolean variable), REview(out of 10) Total minutes listend, Completion (from 0 to 1) Support requests(number), and LAst visited minus purchase data ((in days)\n",
    "\n",
    "So these are the inputs(excluding customerID, as it is completely arbitary. It's more like a name, than a number)\n",
    "\n",
    "The targets are a boolean variable (so 0 or 1). We are taking a period of 2 years in our inputs, and the next 6 months as targets. So, in face, we are predicting if based on the last 2 years of activiy and engaement a customer will convert in the next 6 months, 6 months sound like a reasonable time. If they don't convert after 6 months, chances are they've gone to a competitor or didn't like the audiobook way fo digesting information.\n",
    "\n",
    "That task is simple: create a machine learning algorithm, which is able to predict if a customer will buy again.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classification problem with two classes. won't buy and will buy, represented by 0s or 1s.\n",
